# The Legal Framework

NHS Digital has published two safety standards established in law through the Health and Social Care Act 2012, Section 250. These standards, which have existed since 2009, set a framework for effective digital clinical risk management in both manufacturer and deployment organisations.

## NHS Digital Safety Standards

### DCB0129
This standard sets clinical risk management requirements for manufacturers of Health Information Technology (HIT) systems.

### DCB0160
This standard sets clinical risk management requirements for the deployment and use of HIT systems.

### Value of the Safety Standards:

- Establishes a safety culture for both the manufacture and use of HIT systems.
- Top management commitment, resources, and responsibilities.
- Promotes structured thinking.
- Provides a repeatable process with decision points.
- Establishes an evidence base.

Health organisations must ensure that digital technology is safe to use within their organisation, considering the scope of their chosen care setting. Any local customisations need to be safety assessed by the health organisation before going live.

## Clinical Safety Officer (CSO)

The standards mandate that organisations must have a Clinical Safety Officer (CSO).

### A CSO Should Be:

- Knowledgeable in health IT clinical risk management.
- Accountable for clinical risk management.
- Professionally registered.
- A qualified and experienced clinician.

### Role of the CSO

- The CSO will sign off or approve the clinical risk management plan, the Clinical Safety Case Report (CSCR), and the hazard log.
- While the CSO is responsible for signing off key documentation, digital clinical safety requires a multidisciplinary approach. Members of the organisation will support digital clinical safety processes and deliverables.

## Reflection

Consider the following statements:

- Which standard is applicable to manufacturers?
- How do the standards prevent safety incidents?

### Feedback

- **DCB0129** is the standard that manufacturers must follow.
- The requirements within the standards ensure patient harm is considered and managed when developing or using HIT. Safety controls are put in place where hazardous situations are identified. The standards prompt manufacturers and health organisations to consider:
  - What could go wrong?
  - How bad could it be?
  - What can be done to mitigate it?
